Scream green ocean  
Embodied within  
Night on earth  
The hollow tusk  

Is filled with rock  
A hidden belt moves  
Cross the  
Depth  

Arcane fire  
Feel you well  
My quiet aquatic  
Delirium  

Bluest portal  
Make me hole  
I paint no stripe  
Across your bottom  

I know  
I know you only  
If I drown  

Sweet abyss  
One path remains  
Outside the shelf  

Swells appear  
A deathly finger  
Frozen asset  
Sun, extolled  

Echo of knowing  
My half is rotten  
Find me here  
Telltale tear  

Weakly  
Perplexed  
Fall down  
Sky-sea  
Hexed.
