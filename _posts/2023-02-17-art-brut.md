Crossing the distance  
Cross in the distance  
Go thither  
Journeyman  
Before the day  
Is done

There's no return  
No stopping  
This trajectory  
Infinite wavelength  
Fire in the tree  
Motion and velocity  
Ferocity  
It lives in me

Is that a tear?  
Pulled from the earth  
Falling down  
With me  
I don't believe  
In you  
I don't believe  
The truth
