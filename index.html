<p>Working as a postdoctoral fellow at Leipzig University’s <a href="https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/" target="_blank">Collaborative Research Centre 1199: "Processes of Spatialization under the Global Condition"</a>, I have recently published <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/573797" target="_blank"><em>The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse</em></a> (2020).</p>

<p>My research interests include:
<ul>
<li>Imaginations and representations of space in literature</li>
