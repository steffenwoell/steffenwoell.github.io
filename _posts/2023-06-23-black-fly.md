What you want is  
Not that scarce  
An open eye  
Broken skin  
Darkness  
Scars
  
Round the world  
A buzzing heard  
Black spot  
Blue sky  
Metallic vision  
Lifeline blurred

Surgical lance  
Slam  
Into this hide  
Womb of time  
Ouroboros  
Was / is / am

Desideratum  
Black fly  
Sing your  
Toughest song  
Forever you  
Eternal sigh
