Who's doing this?  
Who's drawing this line  
Between night and day  
On which we walk and  
Divide ourselves  
At once  

Who's hating us  
And splits our lives  
In pieces ever smaller  
With each day  

Who sees us shrinking into  
Futures, flashes, gazes  
Compressed in rocks and faces and  
Slowly drained by an underground spring  

As the ridge line grows dimmer  
I see your face from far away  
Who's doing this?  
Who's smiling at us?
