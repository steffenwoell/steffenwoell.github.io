Fire that burns with  
Invisible flame  
Thumping and churning  
Twisting and turning

I lunge upon myself  
This journey â€”  
Framed by secret mirrors

A tumbling leaf  
As opaque sorrow

Eff-eff-em, again  
Clouds hang heavy  
Around your ever looking  
Glassy face  
Cut in twain  
Your global promise

Stay or leave  
Black and white  
Dig deep  
Subdue the terra

No sleep  
Non-place  
Phoenix in onyx  
*You* are the night.
