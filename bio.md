**Updated:** December 4, 2019.

In 2016, I received my master’s degree from the [Institute for American Studies](http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de) at Leipzig University with a paper about "American Spaces: Renegotiations of Cultural Geographies and Counter-Drafts to Spatial Master Narratives of the American West in Jack London’s Short Stories."

I'm employed as a research fellow (soon to be postdoc) at [Collaborative Research Centre 1199](https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/). Currently, I'm in the process of publishing my doctoral thesis that revolves around discursive spatialization processes in the American West in nineteenth-century literature and culture. The thesis is titled "The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse" and will come out at de Gruyter publishing house in 2020.

My research interests include, but are not limited to:

* Imaginations and representations of spatio-cultural (meta)narratives
* The literary nexus of space, mobility, agency, and otherness
* Trans-hemispheric and trans-oceanic visions of New Imperialism
* Religious and (sub)cultural radicalism
