Touch of time  
The roughest hands  
Shoulders like mountains  
Running towards  
Unyielding power  
Abrasive futures  

Enclosed in ravines  
Black wheel sun  
Scream into the abyss  
Animal moon  
Echoing the undefined  
Guilt by definition  

Don’t turn your back  
Son of contrition  
Whitest blankets line your night  
Supine flowers bloom beyond  
The careless river flows forever  
Father, I have lied.
