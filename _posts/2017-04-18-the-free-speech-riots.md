Lyrics:

It doesn’t matters how you wear your hair
It’s what inside your head
United Forces stand for all strong and fair
Black, white and yellow and red

United forces, united forces, united
United forces, united forces, united

Skinheads and bangers and punks stand as one
Crossover to a final scene
United forces and our job won’t be done
Until the world can see

United forces, united forces, united
United forces, united forces, united

No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes
United forces can’t be stopped
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes
United forces can’t be stopped
