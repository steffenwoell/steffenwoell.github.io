Night out, light out  
Silken air, cycling sweat  
Streets distorted, blood-red lane  
Holler, call, bass line  
No stopping, bottom line  
Eyes unblinking  
Pulsating heart  
Announcing from afar  
A not so distant fate  
Faint echoes  
Booming through obsidian alleys  
Backlit silhouettes  
White-knuckling  
Brushing up  
Heavy metal  
Supine steel  
Crunching teeth  
Rolling gait  
Gripping digit  
Chromatic flash  
Prickle, spray, taste  
Arterial mist  
These prayers shouted  
Into the carnal void  
Embryonic agent  
Polymer substrate  
Feel something  
At last  
Universal adage  
Masking agent  
Rite to cure a fever  
Slow riot  
Age-old anxiety  
Where will I be?
