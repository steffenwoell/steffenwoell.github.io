Real life is  
taking space  
a path appears  
within old snow  
for those who travel

One look exchanged  
tells many stories  
each breath  
a bold sonata

A face appears  
in black and white  
once just touched  
by death and  
nothing left to  
fear

A life  
collected  
All hope  
deflected  
the suitcase  
never remains  
forever full  
of shadows
