**Updated:** 5 July 2020

Working as a postdoctoral fellow at Leipzig University's [Collaborative Research Centre 1199](https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/), I'm currently in the process of publishing my doctoral thesis with the title "The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse."

In 2016, I received my master’s degree from the [Institute for American Studies](http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de) at Leipzig University with a paper about "American Spaces: Renegotiations of Cultural Geographies and Counter-Drafts to Spatial Master Narratives of the American West in Jack London’s Short Stories."

My research interests include, but are not limited to:

* Imaginations and representations of spatio-cultural (meta)narratives
* The narrative nexus of space, mobility, agency, and otherness
* Trans-hemispheric and trans-oceanic (re)visions of fin de siècle imperialism
* (Sub)cultural and millennialist apocalypticism

A complete list of publications can be found [here](../publications).
