Repress these thoughts 
a tearing asunder  
milky lens and foggy bottom  
a cure for you, oh  
wretched race  

Who dares to gaze  
upon thy face  
shall catch a glimpse of  
floating cinder and  
raze the city to the ground  

Breathin' ever only  
in the margins  
in the space  
between the pages  
a shoulder to cry  

Existence / eXistenZ  
a body to flatten  
so wholesome - forbidden  
so hidden - entrenched  
a thought that  
never dies but  

Paint this moment  
in hierogylphic wavelength  
patterns washed into this  
human thicket  

My swan  
my swan  
don't look beyond  
your Delta  
don't turn around  
your Nile.
