A liquid sense of  
Self in mirror  
My dreams  
Are they a part  
of what *really* happened?  

Referring to oneself  
Means restructuring the self  
Facing contraction  
Constructing contradiction  
Crawling through constricted spaces  
Breathing in the dust of ages  

Vibrant presence  
Appearing all at once  
Painted in smoke  
Surprise  
I got eyes  
To see another world  
An absence from being  
And wishing well to all  

Gaps in the narrative  
Rattling on empty cages  
We cannot split ourselves  
From history  
But still  
This tomb is empty  
And still  
These stones are mute  
Oh well.
