Who has asked us  
to pass through gates  
when the day goes out  
and fires awaken  
the work of a thousand hands  

Amongst trees, stones, tents  
sigh, twitch, flicker  
wreathed shadows  
the ritual  
the ashen hand  
the bronzen tongue  
the bitter drink

The seed of hate  
sprouts fresh  
in our midst  
entwines us  
into deepest roots and  
feeds us from  
the ripest berries  

An old fiend arises  
from new flesh  
in likenesses  
of icy steel  
on a dull mirror  
that is mine.
