Sound of the future  
Crawling slowly  
Through ravines  
Nearby echo  
In sickness  
And in health  
That's me  
Only more so  
We're all  
On the inside  
Looking out  
Moroder marauder  
Dissonant bodies  
Expanding and collapsing  
Vagary  
∂iscovery  
Making space  
In time  
Final breath  
Sublime.
