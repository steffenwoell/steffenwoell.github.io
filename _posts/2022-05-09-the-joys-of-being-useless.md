It seems a lot of time has passed  
pursuing life at breakneck paces  
we crane our necks and look  
down at crowded streets  
and all those vacant spaces  

Where dust and free papers collect  
in shrinking gaps between what  
makes us human and  
the listless thrashings of machines  

Today I found a penny  
in one of those gaps  
wedged between a curb and tire  
I stopped and saw myself  
reflected in that penny  
almost worthless  
one of many  

I looked around and kicked it loose  
the copper sprung and beamed its verges  
navigating storm drain girders  
darting through the spokes of riders  
blinding unsuspecting drivers  

Staring down train operators  
ripping open bags of noodles  
bouncing off the tags of poodles  
splitting skulls and chipping phones  
scratching watches, breaking bones  
bursting open rings of doves  
shining over those it loves  

Embedding itself into crevasses  
behind the visible  
beyond the thinkable  
across from that which is of use  
it seems to ask  
what is joy but the debt of many?  
what is life but a foundling penny?
