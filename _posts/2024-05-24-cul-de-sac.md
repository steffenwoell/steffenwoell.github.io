Paradise is always  
Somewhere else  
Sonic booms  
And lightning strikes  
The end of our street  

Woman flying by  
On a Dutch bicycle  
Child in yellow raincoat  
Swirling around  
Magpie ducking  
Under a rusty balcony  
Man with no distinctive features    
Secures a jardinière  

Figures disappear behind  
Curtains of rain  
Flowing purposely  
From those great  
Unthinking heights  

Awash  
I feel my wishes  
Showing  
In every drop  

Submerged and  
Growing  
Unearth a  
Wilted iris  

My firmly fixed  
But endless flowing  
’til it arrives  
I’ll take the flak  
’til I arrive  
At my cul-de-sac.
