Drums from the depth  
A crust so plump  
It swallows  
It bellows  
The gallows  
Await  

Hollow stare  
Thrash in the streets  
Arterial wave  
Bloodshot eye  
Stares hollow  
I follow  

Cypher impending  
Break the skin  
Artificial tear  
A nightblack mare  
The endless stream  
Runs shallow.
