See you when I/C/U   
Eye and finger  
Bruised but  
Linger  

Black hole  
Outside my sol is  
Growing darker every day  
So uhm, and oh, but a-okay  

Modicum of growth outside  
My head is where it’s @  
Stop pushing daisies  
Don’t get me dead  

Viscera defiant  
Awaiting my number  
Twelve hundred and sixty  
Days away from glee o’er yonder
