<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at Leipzig University’s collaborative research center (CRC/SFB) 1199 “Processes of Spatialization under the Global Condition.” I have published on various and intersectional topics in American Studies, including spatial imaginations, border studies, naturalism, postmodernism, as well as film and horror studies. I am the author of <em>The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse</em> (de Gruyter 2020) and co-founder of the European Network for Minor Mobilities in the Americas that brings together European scholars in the fields of transnational, border, and mobility studies. My current research investigates the transoceanic dynamics of the United States’ imperial and literary discourses.</p>
