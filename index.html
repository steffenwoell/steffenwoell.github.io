<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at Leipzig University’s collaborative research center (CRC/SFB) 1199 “Processes of Spatialization under the Global Condition.” I have published on various and intersectional topics in American Studies, including spatial imaginations, border studies, naturalism, postmodernism, as well as film and horror studies.</p>

<p>I am the author of <em>The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse</em> (de Gruyter 2020) and co-founder of the European Network for Minor Mobilities in the Americas that brings together European scholars in the fields of transnational, border, and mobility studies.</p>
