Return your gaze  
To soothing self  
Your other  
Nonplus the tether  
All black tonight  
The purplest phase  
Unpluck the feather  
Refuse the offer  
Not to be

A fracture  
And always between  
Lethargy embroiled  
Detritus half-life  
Coursing through  
You  
All is cool  
All in motion  
All today  
Run away.
