Gray ship has landed  
Anchor will fall  
Anvil struck fierce  
My sleep, myself  
Neverending, bitter flow  

Hundred hammers  
Silent spark  
Hole in the sky  
Await the day  
Embrace the dark  

A house of cards  
My secret gamble  
Solemn day  
I thrust into  
The shallow bay  

To give back  
What I do not own  
This fragile ring of yonder  
My constant, fleeting  
Sense of wonder
