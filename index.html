<p>Coming from a background in American Studies, I am a postdoctoral fellow at Leipzig University&#8217;s <a href="https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/" target="_blank">Collaborative Research Centre 1199 &#8220;Processes of Spatialization under the Global Condition</a>.&#8221; I have published on various topics including spatial imaginations and border studies, naturalism, postmodernism, as well as film and horror studies. Recently, the monograph <em>The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse</em> was published. My current research project investigates archipelagic literary dynamics in American imperial discourses between 1880 and 1945.</p>

<p>My research interests include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Imaginations and representations of space</li>
<li>Mobility and borderedness</li>
<li>Film, game, and horror studies</li>
<li>Survivalism and apocalypticism</li>
</ul>
