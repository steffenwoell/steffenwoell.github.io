I lost it in my sleep  
The center of myself  
Collapsed  
To fears and worry  
I, myself  
A pest and leper  
Altered beast  

It came from underneath  
A giant wave  
The darkened moon  
A mouth of ashes  
A heavy thought  
The scars of living  

But soon, I'll rise from that gloom  
I'll ride the wave  
Swallow the ashes  
And leave behind  
What is not real  
Cause I am going home  
With thoughts of you  
My joy of living.
