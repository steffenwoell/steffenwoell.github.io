Ripped her jeans  
At the knee  
Cut his teeth  
In the air  
Cut my hands  
On a reef  

Still you're here  
Frowning quiet  
At our scars  
In my dreams  
You're there  
Alone, afar  

Broke her arm  
In a car  
Split his lip  
In the dark  
Pierced my feet  
On rusty nails  
And broken bottles  

Like a dark star  
Rose overnight  
Shadowy outline  
A censure of light  
That pulls me in  
Absence as presence  
The wounded cosmos  
Sin.
