For a complete CV see my <a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/personenprofil/mitarbeiter/steffen-adrian-woell/" target="_blank">personal profile at Leipzig University</a>.

Working as a postdoctoral fellow at Leipzig University's [Collaborative Research Centre 1199](https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/), I have published articles on various and intersectional topics of American studies, including postmodern and naturalist literature, spatial imaginations, border studies, as well as film and horror studies. Recently, the monograph *The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse* (2020) was published with de Gruyter.

My research interests include

* Imaginations and representations of spatio-cultural (meta)narratives
* The narrative nexus of space, mobility, agency, and otherness
* Trans-hemispheric and trans-oceanic (re)visions of fin de siècle imperialism
* (Sub)cultural and millennialist apocalypticism

A complete list of publications can be found [here](../publications).
