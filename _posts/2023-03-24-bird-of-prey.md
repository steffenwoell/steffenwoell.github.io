Circles and colors  
A brittle abode  
Come round to my  
Dwelling  
In shine and in rain  
My glistening feathers  
Will rise not in vain

Most all that have spied me  
Have laid down  
For good  
In layers and earth works  
As best as they could  
They follow my spirals  
Not coming apart

They watch now  
Through cloud scraps  
A tide grow  
A storm rise  
My beak point  
To never  
Forever  
Feed  
This ever-beating  
Heart.
