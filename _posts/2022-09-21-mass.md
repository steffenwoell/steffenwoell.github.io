Spell is cast  
A sin, redeemed  
Splits the night  
The white expanse  
Marches alone  
But canâ€™t escape  
The howling wind  
Eternal wheel  
Frozen fog of ages  
Unmovable light  
Head of ashes  
Purity of decay  
The final age  
Erupts within  
Unchanging truth  
Flows a fire  
Embalms this horde  
Of others  
To sprout again  
A stronger hand.
