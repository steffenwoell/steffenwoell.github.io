Pass me by  
You fleeting gaze  
My evil I  
Seventh Mask  
My plastique  
Face  

A cut across  
All flesh will  
Follow fire  
My mouth is full  
But body bloody —  
Starved  

Like a bird  
On a wire  
Chime in the  
Wind  
Guiltily staying  
Reluctantly swaying  

The world  
It has two  
Icy eyes  
To close  
Too late  
Upon the night  

A glove  
Or shoe –  
A gentle  
Word  
Will make  
It right.
