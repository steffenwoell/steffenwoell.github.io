Imperial sun  
rises  

Cerebral scream  
fills this  
two-sided room  

Hail of hatred  
bloody rune  

We pull on  
that gossamer  
thread  

Smile in the  
glow of a  
skin-colored  
cigarette  

Unholy  
fire but  
I chose to  
forget  

Krakked armor  
my guilty  
flesh unbroken  
(yet)  

A prying eye  
a face of death  
in soil  
reflected  

A youth  
too short  
for tears—  
deflected  

Still  
I greet this morn  
a day so vast  

The deepest drum  
shall sound  
my worry  

A burned up page  
will tell my story—  
(sorry)
