<p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Leipzig University’s collaborative research center <a href="https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/" target="_blank">SFB (CRC) 1199</a> Processes of Spatialization under the Global Condition. I have published on various and intersectional topics in American Studies, including spatial imaginations, border studies, naturalism, postmodernism, as well as film and horror studies.</p>

<p>I am the author of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110690132" target="_blank">The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse</a> (de Gruyter 2020) and co-founder of the <a href="https://enmma.org/" target="_blank">European Network for Minor Mobilities in the Americas</a> that brings together European scholars in the fields of transnational, border, and mobility studies.</p>
