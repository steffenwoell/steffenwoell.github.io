A floating nothingness,  
the beat drives infinity.  
What have we  
become—your pale face  
in the neon light.  
A clockwork broken  
Amelie Lens in  
10,000 meters, power & virtue  
adrenaline, trapped in  
Faraday cage.  

The seas are calling me, a silent  
anarchy of magnetism,  
Atlantic power. A vortex  
of swarms, flowing reflection,  
silver idol. And nothing becomes  
something that embraces everything  
we have become water, we  
drink the night.  

We are without end,  
vanishing points of being,  
a snare, a rope, a tether  
a drifting, a falling, a new  
beginning. There remains nothing to  
be said, nothing to be done,  
fate and destiny, the universe is made  
new each second. Mud becomes star  
becomes pain, wealth becomes dirt  
from deepest heart.  
To those parting I say "hello,"  
to those here, to this place "nowhere."
