Vast horizon  
fall in place  
ain’t no tunnels  
under those teeth  
none of em are fake

Cops parked  
in webs  
of shadows  
under a bearded tree  
bear witness to  
the levee break

Rusty remnants  
symbols, rites  
nothing to see here  
cause reality bites

Unpaved streets  
a shack of trifles  
jacked up pickups  
sticks as markers  
butts of rifles

A brush of gray  
comes creeping in  
we hear them laughing  
we’ve heard em sing  
eyes unblinking  
sweat entangled  
in their brow  
nothing to do here  
but pray.
