Remembered  
embodied  
a bloodied  

speck  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inked  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my finger  

Marked by birth  
needle-pricked  
a sore-red eye  

Focus on you  
means absence  
of my  

Root-pierced sleep  
aloof, embedded in  
always-already-penultimate night  

Onyx-tinted  
jaded  
emptied sky  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My body-works  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;α cypher  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— dye  

Shaded gaze  
sloughed off  
new skin unveils  
a coward's smile.
