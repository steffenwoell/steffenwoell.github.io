In a dusty corner inside my room

Behind some silken cover

I found a coat of arms

For me to wear

In a city of the ancient rites

Imperial alcoves and ornate groves

I came here and it's hard to bear

For some of us it's tough to swallow

Dealing with these diatribes

Of kneeling, naked, shallow

Shallow.

And none of this seems right

I'm not on time but never late

Why can't I just go home?

Why can't I wear the night?

Like a solemn oath, a blanket for those lighting eyes

A coat of arms for my desire

That will not fit

That never fits.
