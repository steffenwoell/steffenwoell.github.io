> It doesn't matters how you wear your hair<br/>
It's what inside your head<br/>
United Forces stand for all strong and fair<br/>
Black, white and yellow and red<br/><br/>
United forces, united forces, united<br/>
United forces, united forces, united<br/><br/>
Skinheads and bangers and punks stand as one<br/>
Crossover to a final scene<br/>
United forces and our job won't be done<br/>
Until the world can see<br/><br/>
United forces, united forces, united<br/>
United forces, united forces, united<br/><br/>
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes<br/>
United forces can't be stopped<br/>
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes<br/>
United forces can't be stopped
