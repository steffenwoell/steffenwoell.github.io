Remembered  
embodied  
a bloodied  

speck
    inked  
        on  
            my finger  

Marked by birth  
needle-pricked  
a sore-red eye  

Focus on you  
means absence  
of my  

Root-pierced sleep  
aloof, embedded in  
always-already-penultimate night  

Onyx-tinted  
jaded  
emptied sky  

        My body-works  
    α cypher  
            — dye  

Shaded gaze  
sloughed off  
new skin unveils  
a coward's smile.
