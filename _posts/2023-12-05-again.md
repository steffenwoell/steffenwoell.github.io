Night dive  
the vessel is crushed  
in glassy clutches  
light is lost

I'm still thinking  
of you  
figure on the runway  
skater on the rink

clad in swirling  
snow  
your shadow hardened  
nonetheless

a single tear may  
scare you off  
eternal diver  
my soothing delight

a hunter is waiting  
amongst your  
sweetened brush  
with dusty faces  
we are found, again  
on the ground of  
bottomless holes

To overflow  
into the night  
below  
returning our loss  
to those who  
belong  
with you.
