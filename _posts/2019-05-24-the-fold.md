Unfold the flag  
A mouth of teeth  
A monument  
And tiger stripes  

We are the fold,  
We live  
Within  
Each other  

Tucked away  
In starry skies  
And are in flight  
forever  

Up here  
Me is not a word  
Down there  
I am not the world  

But you are it  
And both  
to me  

Wherever I am  
You're on my flag  
You are my flight  
You're in my fold.
