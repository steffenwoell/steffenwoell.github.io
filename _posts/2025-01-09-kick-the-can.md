Did you hear  
that sound  
unruly night  
it’s catching up  

I’m on my way  
so how can you  
forget what you’ve  
just found  

Looking up  
burrowed in a million faces  
under ever paler  
sheets of breath  

Asphalt icon  
te salutant  
my hallowed  
empyre  

Just one more night  
take what I can  
become myself  
and kick the can.
