Meet me  
Where we  
Used to go  
In circles  
Every inch  
We walked  
Every day  
We talked  
In circles  

Stopping only  
At our faves  
Dark dives  
Shooting pool  
Drifting slowly  
From our stools  

Still  
Can't stop  
Wasting  
What we had  
Can't stop  
Tasting  
Sweet defeat  
Bloody kisses  
Always in circles  
Never in line.
