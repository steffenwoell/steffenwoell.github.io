<p>Working as a postdoctoral fellow at Leipzig University's <a href="https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/" target="_blank">Collaborative Research Centre 1199</a>, I am currently in the process of publishing my doctoral thesis with the title "The West and the Word: Imagining, Formatting, and Ordering the American West in Nineteenth-Century Cultural Discourse."</p>

<p>In 2016, I received my master's degree from the <a href="http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de" target="_blank">Institute for American Studies</a> at Leipzig University with a paper about "American Spaces: Renegotiations of Cultural Geographies and Counter-Drafts to Spatial Master Narratives of the American West in Jack London's Short Stories."</p>

<p>My research interests include:
<ul>
<li>Imaginations and representations of spatio-cultural (meta)narratives</li>
<li>The narrative nexus of space, mobility, agency, and otherness</li>
<li>Trans-hemispheric and trans-oceanic (re)visions of fin de siècle imperialism</li>
<li>(Sub)cultural and millennialist apocalypticism</li>
</ul>
