Never knowing  
Where to stand  
I lay my hide  
Between these pillars  

Of the most imperfect union  
Where fastest trains  
Won't pick  
Us up  

Where smoke billows  
I will not cross  
Under a gallows  
Or gossamer path  

Between the walls  
We sleep with  
Feet  
Unbroken  

Amongst the fickle  
Flows of power  
As necks and heads  
and hopes collide  

A perfect stranger  
Takes my side  
We can't remain  
We can't abide  

My lioness  
You must confess  
The empire stays  
Powerless.
