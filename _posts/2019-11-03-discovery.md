*Discovery* became the third operational orbiter to enter service, preceded by *Columbia* and *Challenger*. It embarked on its last mission, STS-133, on February 24, 2011 and touched down for the final time at Kennedy Space Center on March 9, having spent a cumulative total of almost a full year in space. *Discovery* performed both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions, and also carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.

>"I am so glad we got to land here at Kennedy, the home of Discovery," STS-133 Commander Steve Lindsey said. "As the minutes pass, I'm actually getting sadder and sadder about this being the last flight and I know all the folks involved with the shuttle program feel the same way."
