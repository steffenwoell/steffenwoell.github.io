> It doesn't matters how you wear your hair<br>
It's what inside your head<br>
United Forces stand for all strong and fair<br>
Black, white and yellow and red<br><br>
United forces, united forces, united<br>
United forces, united forces, united<br><br>
Skinheads and bangers and punks stand as one<br>
Crossover to a final scene<br>
United forces and our job won't be done<br>
Until the world can see<br><br>
United forces, united forces, united<br>
United forces, united forces, united<br><br>
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes<br>
United forces can't be stopped<br>
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes<br>
United forces can't be stopped
