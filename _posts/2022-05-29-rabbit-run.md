Nights of sullen smog  
put a record on  
fading songs and mumbled lyrics  
burning whales washed up at your door  
all that was promised was  
a summer of lies  
vibrating in your throat  
pulsing, scarring itch  
resting atop the life-needle's edge  
gasping at eroding breath  
mathematically deconstructing  
exhaling static energy  
none have returned  
from gazing silvan centers  
don't ask their names  
feeders of souls  
placeless natives  
each a beggar  
dwellers in bottomless holes  
faithless masses  
toxic droplets  
ruined rivers  
a faceless people  
pushed into the callous waves  
run, rabbit  
run.
