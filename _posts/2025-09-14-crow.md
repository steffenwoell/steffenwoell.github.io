you whisper something in my ear  
i cannot hear  
i cannot—here  

noise nests  
in dark corners  
of my room  

fruitless fields abide  
behind my eyes  
inside my Is  

my skull intact  
this air is mine  
to scream  

my pride  
to fold  
retract  

i’ll walk the walk  
i’ll eat the crow  
hide nothing that I cannot show.
