Heavy, we'll be  
and roughly round  
a Forepaugh's daughter  
always anemic and  
moving below the  
bottommost chamber  

Is a fragment ever whole?  
Is a splinter ever just itself?  
Is that skyward gaze forever null?  

May dust be yours  
These buoyant fingers grasp no thing  
There's naught outside  
That wasn't seen  

Who dares  
Who stares  
Shall break the atom  

A perfect form  
Can't be undone  
A cannonball not taken back  
A sordid word  
Can't be contained  
Within self-serving breath
