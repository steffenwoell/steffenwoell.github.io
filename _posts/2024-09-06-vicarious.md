Storm shadow  
Peeling from the wire  
Congested throats  
Shot-through  
Ambivalent patterns  

Cloud shadow  
Strike shadow  
Piercing my structure  
Visceral vapor  
Draws an empty shape  

Ghost shadow  
Translucent gestalt  
Motor breath  
Engine of death  
God owes us nothing  

Lives and suffers  
Vicariously  
Supersonic sputter  
Final response  
What does it matter
