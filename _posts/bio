I received my master’s degree from Leipzig University in 2016 with a thesis titled "American Spaces: Renegotiations of Cultural Geographies and Counter-Drafts to Spatial Master Narratives of the American West in Jack London’s Short Stories." My research interests include historical imaginations and representations of national and cultural metanarratives, the literary construction of spatiality, agency, and otherness, as well as religious and cultural radicalism in the US. Currently, I am employed as a research fellow at [Collaborative Research Centre 1199](https://research.uni-leipzig.de/~sfb1199/) and pursuing a PhD with a focus on discursive spatialization processes in the American West in nineteenth-century literature and culture.
