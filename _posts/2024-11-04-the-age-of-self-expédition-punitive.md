Drifting further  
Down this stream  
Fractal inflection  
Incorruptible wire  

Our fathers  
Damned  
Us all—  
Entire  

Argilliferous shape  
Our mothers  
Stacked this  
Pyre  

Of sunken skulls  
A blade to hone  
Your naked face  
Corrupting fire  

Tongues of stone  
Spit rivulets  
So cheap this life  
Obeisance, desire
