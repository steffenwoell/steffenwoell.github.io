Mosquito squeal  
Dainty lance and wound pastiche  
'Tis our body  
Defeated in sunshine  
Drawn-out, droning sound  

We move, and climb, and  
Struggle ever further  
From ourselves  

Looking out from a  
Mass of stars  
Cosmic void that  
Frames our hollow pleas  

Week-old fly  
Half waiting  
Anticipating  
The blow  

Firing synapses  
Muscles so tightly  
Stringed  
Teeth gnashed  

Skin as Albion  
Gently sliding, collapses  
Across piano keys  

Each body round  
All cores extracted  
Against an ever-woven pattern  
Among an ever-rising mist  

Burning and burning  
Forever returning  
To that tiny  
Speck of matter  
Sliding down the  
Endless ladder
